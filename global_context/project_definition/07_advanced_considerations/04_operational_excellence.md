### Operational Excellence & Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)

1.  **Chaos Engineering:** Proactively test system resilience by injecting failures in a controlled environment.
2.  **Automated Incident Response:** Develop automated playbooks and tools to detect, diagnose, and mitigate common incidents without human intervention.
3.  **Performance Budgeting:** Define strict performance budgets for key user journeys and continuously monitor against them, triggering alerts if exceeded.
4.  **Cost Optimization (Cloud):** Implement strategies for optimizing cloud infrastructure costs while maintaining performance and reliability.
5.  **Blue/Green or Canary Deployments:** Advanced deployment strategies to minimize downtime and risk during software releases.
6.  **Observability:** Beyond monitoring, ensure the system is fully observable with comprehensive logging, metrics, and tracing to understand its internal state.
