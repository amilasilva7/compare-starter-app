# Regulatory Compliance

This document outlines the key regulatory bodies and compliance requirements relevant to our UK Price Comparison Website (PCW) operating in the financial services sector. Adherence to these regulations is paramount to ensure consumer protection, fair competition, and data privacy.

## 1. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)

The FCA is the primary regulator for financial services firms in the UK, including PCWs involved in insurance distribution. Our compliance will focus on:

*   **Consumer Protection:** Ensuring products are suitable for consumer needs, not solely based on the cheapest price. Providing clear, fair, and not misleading information.
*   **Transparency:** Clearly disclosing how the PCW generates revenue (e.g., commissions) and avoiding misleading "free" claims.
*   **Operational Resilience & Data Security:** Maintaining robust systems and controls to protect against disruptions and cyber threats, safeguarding sensitive customer data.
*   **Governance & Culture:** Fostering a customer-centric culture with effective governance.
*   **Senior Managers & Certification Regime (SMCR):** Applying relevant SMCR requirements to identified staff.

## 2. Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) - UK GDPR

The ICO enforces the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018, which are critical for handling personal data. Our compliance will adhere to:

*   **Data Protection Principles:** Fairness, transparency, purpose limitation, data minimisation, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity, confidentiality, and accountability.
*   **Individual Rights:** Respecting and facilitating individual rights (e.g., access, rectification, erasure, restriction, data portability, objection).
*   **Lawful Basis:** Ensuring a clear lawful basis for all data processing activities.
*   **Security:** Implementing appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of personal data, preventing breaches.

## 3. Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)

The CMA ensures fair competition and protects consumers from anti-competitive practices. We will adhere to their "CARE" principles:

*   **CARE Principles:**
    *   **Clear:** Information about products, prices, and how the PCW works must be clear and easy to understand.
    *   **Accurate:** All information provided must be accurate and up-to-date.
    *   **Responsible:** PCWs must act responsibly, avoiding misleading practices or unfair terms.
    *   **Easy to Use:** The platform should be user-friendly and facilitate informed decision-making.
*   **Transparency:** Clearly disclosing revenue models, the number of deals displayed, and the methodology for ordering results.
*   **Competition Law:** Avoiding anti-competitive practices, such as exclusive agreements with providers that restrict choice.

## 4. Advertising Standards Authority (ASA)

The ASA regulates advertising in the UK to ensure it is legal, decent, honest, and truthful. Our advertising and marketing communications will be:

*   **Honest & Truthful:** Factually correct and not misleading.
*   **Substantiated:** Claims made must be capable of substantiation.
*   **Fair:** Advertising should not exploit consumers' inexperience or credulity.

Our application development and operational processes will embed these regulatory requirements from design to deployment. This includes regular audits, staff training, and a robust compliance framework.
