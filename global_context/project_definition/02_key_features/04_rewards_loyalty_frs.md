### **6. UI/UX Considerations:**

*   **Design System Adherence:** The UI SHALL strictly adhere to the Agoda-inspired visual theme and component library defined in `09_ui_ux_accessibility/01_design_system_guidelines.md`. This includes color palette, typography (Roboto), card-based layouts, and 4px border radius.

### **7. Technical Considerations:**

*   **Microservices Involved:**
    *   **Frontend (React):** Renders rewards program pages, user status, redemption options, and referral section.
    *   **Web App BFF (Node.js/Express):** Aggregates data from `Users Service` and `Monetization Service` to display loyalty status and manage reward redemptions.
    *   **Users Service (Node.js/Express):** Manages user accounts and potentially stores loyalty tier information.
    *   **Monetization Service (Node.js/Express):** Manages loyalty program rules, tracks earned rewards, handles redemption logic, and processes referral commissions.
*   **State Management:**
    *   **Frontend UI State:** Managed using React Hooks (e.g., for redemption modals) and Redux Toolkit (`createSlice` for user loyalty status).
    *   **Rewards Data State:** Managed using RTK Query for fetching and caching user-specific rewards data.
*   **Data Models:** Introduce `LoyaltyProgram`, `Reward`, and `Referral` models within the `Monetization Service` (refer to `08_data_management/05_database_schema_design.md` for `partner_accounts`, `commission_records`, `performance_metrics` which can be extended).
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for reward redemption and referral tracking.
*   **Dummy Data Strategy (Prototype):**
    *   `Monetization Service` will provide dummy loyalty tiers, earned rewards, and referral statistics.
    *   Redemption will simulate success without actual financial transactions.

### **8. Acceptance Criteria:**

*   A dedicated "Rewards Program" page is accessible and clearly explains the loyalty program.
*   Logged-in users can view their current loyalty tier, progress towards the next tier, and available rewards (dummy data).
*   Users can click a "Redeem Rewards" button and see a simulated redemption confirmation (e.g., a dummy voucher code or cashback message).
*   A "Refer a Friend" section is available, displaying a unique referral link and simulated tracking of referrals.
*   The terms of a price guarantee are clearly communicated on relevant pages.
*   All rewards and loyalty pages are fully responsive and accessible (WCAG 2.1 Level AA).

### **9. Out of Scope (for this prototype iteration):**

*   Actual financial transactions for cashback or complex partner integrations for exclusive deals.
*   Real-time integration with external reward partners (e.g., cinema ticket providers).
*   Advanced fraud detection for referral programs beyond basic tracking.
*   Detailed analytics on reward program effectiveness.
*   User-configurable reward preferences.
*   Full implementation of a price guarantee claim process with human review.
