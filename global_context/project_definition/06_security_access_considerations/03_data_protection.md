### Data Protection (In Transit and At Rest)

1.  **Encryption In Transit (TLS/SSL):** All communication must be encrypted using strong TLS 1.2+ protocols; implement HSTS.
2.  **Encryption At Rest:** Encrypt all sensitive data stored in databases, file systems, and backups (e.g., AES-256, secure key management).
3.  **Data Minimization:** Collect and store only necessary data.
4.  **Data Anonymization/Pseudonymization:** Properly anonymize or pseudonymize data for Data Analysts.
