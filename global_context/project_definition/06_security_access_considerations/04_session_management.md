### Session Management

1.  **Secure Session Tokens:** Generate long, random, unpredictable tokens; store securely (HTTP-only, secure cookies); implement appropriate timeouts.
2.  **Session Invalidation:** Invalidate sessions upon logout, password change, or suspicious activity.
3.  **Protection Against Session Hijacking:** Measures like IP address binding (with caution) and user-agent checks.
