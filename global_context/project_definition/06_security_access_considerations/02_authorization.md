### Authorization (Controlling Access to Resources)

1.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Define distinct roles with granular permissions (principle of least privilege).
2.  **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** For complex scenarios, base access decisions on attributes of user, resource, and environment.
3.  **Secure API Endpoints:** All API endpoints must enforce authorization checks.
