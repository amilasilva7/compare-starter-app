# High-Level Architecture

Our PCW application is designed as a **cloud-native, microservices-based architecture**. This approach allows for independent development, deployment, and scaling of different parts of the system, enhancing resilience and agility.

## Core Principles:

*   **Microservices:** Breaking down the application into small, independent services that communicate via APIs.
*   **Cloud-Native:** Leveraging cloud provider services (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) for infrastructure, managed services, and scalability.
*   **Event-Driven:** Services communicate asynchronously using events where appropriate, improving responsiveness and decoupling.
*   **API-First:** All services expose well-defined APIs for internal and external communication.

## Key Components:

*   **User Interface (Web/Mobile App):** The client-side application that users interact with.
*   **API Gateway:** A single entry point for all client requests, handling routing, authentication, and rate limiting.
*   **Microservices:** Independent services responsible for specific business capabilities (e.g., Comparison, User Profile, Provider Integration).
*   **Data Stores:** Dedicated databases for each service or logical grouping of data.
*   **Message Broker:** Facilitates asynchronous communication between services and enables event-driven architectures.
*   **External Provider APIs:** Integrations with third-party insurance, utility, and financial providers.
*   **Analytics & BI:** Services for collecting, processing, and visualizing application data.
*   **Admin Panel:** Internal tool for managing the platform, users, and providers.

This architecture promotes resilience, scalability, and allows teams to work independently on different services.
