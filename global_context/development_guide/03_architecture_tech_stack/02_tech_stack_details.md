# Tech Stack Details

This section outlines the core technologies and frameworks used across the PCW application. The choices are driven by considerations for scalability, performance, developer productivity, and maintainability.

## 1. Frontend
*   **Framework:** React.js
*   **Language:** JavaScript (or TypeScript)
*   **Styling:** CSS/Sass, or a component library like Material-UI
*   **State Management:** Redux Toolkit or React Context API
*   **Testing:** Jest, React Testing Library

## 2. Backend Services
*   **Runtime:** Node.js
*   **Framework:** Express.js
*   **Language:** JavaScript (or TypeScript)
*   **Testing:** Jest, Supertest

## 3. Database
*   **Database:** MongoDB
*   **ODM (Object Data Modeling):** Mongoose
*   **Caching:** Redis (Optional, for session management or caching)

## 4. Cloud Infrastructure
*   **Provider:** A cloud provider like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
*   **Key Services:**
    *   **Compute:** Node.js runtime environment (e.g., AWS EC2, Heroku, Vercel)
    *   **Database Hosting:** MongoDB Atlas, or self-hosted on a cloud VM.
    *   **Storage:** Cloud storage for static assets (e.g., AWS S3).

## 5. Messaging and Event Streaming
*   **Primary Choice:** Apache Kafka is recommended for handling real-time data feeds, event-driven architecture, and communication between microservices.
*   **Node.js Library:** `kafkajs` is the preferred modern client. It is free, open-source, and well-supported by the community.
*   **Alternatives:** For simpler use cases or different needs, `RabbitMQ` or `Redis Pub/Sub` can also be considered.

## 6. CI/CD & DevOps
*   **Version Control:** Git (GitHub)
*   **CI/CD Platform:** GitHub Actions / GitLab CI / AWS CodePipeline
*   **Containerization:** Docker
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform

## 7. Other Tools
*   **API Documentation:** OpenAPI/Swagger UI
*   **Message Broker:** Apache Kafka (for event streaming)
*   **Search:** Elasticsearch (for full-text search capabilities)
*   **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana
*   **Logging:** ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
