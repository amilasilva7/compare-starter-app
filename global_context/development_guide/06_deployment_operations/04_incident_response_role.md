# Incident Response & Developer Role

This document outlines the process for incident response and clarifies the role of developers in ensuring the stability and reliability of the PCW application.

## 1. What is an Incident?

An incident is any unplanned interruption to a service or reduction in the quality of a service. For example:
*   Application is down or unresponsive.
*   Key feature is not working as expected.
*   Performance degradation (e.g., slow comparisons).
*   Security breach or suspected breach.
*   Critical alerts triggered by monitoring systems.

## 2. Incident Severity Levels

Incidents are classified by severity to prioritize response efforts:
*   **Severity 1 (Critical):** Major outage, core functionality is down, significant user impact, reputational damage, financial loss.
*   **Severity 2 (High):** Significant degradation, major component failing, moderate user impact, no immediate workaround.
*   **Severity 3 (Medium):** Minor component affected, limited user impact, temporary workaround exists.
*   **Severity 4 (Low):** Minor issue, no immediate user impact, cosmetic problem.

## 4. Developer's Role in Incident Response

*   **On-Call Rotation:** Developers participate in an on-call rotation to provide 24/7 coverage for critical incidents.
*   **Alert Acknowledgment:** Promptly acknowledge alerts and assess the impact.
*   **First Responder:** As a first responder, your role is to:
    *   Verify the incident.
    *   Gather initial information (logs, metrics, recent deployments).
    *   Attempt immediate mitigation or rollback if safe to do so.
    *   Engage relevant team members or the Incident Commander.
*   **Diagnosis & Resolution:** Collaborate with the incident response team to diagnose the root cause and implement a fix.
*   **Post-Incident Review:** Actively participate in post-incident reviews (postmortems) to understand what happened, why, and what can be done to prevent recurrence.
*   **Implement Follow-Up Actions:** Address action items identified during post-incident reviews (e.g., improving monitoring, fixing bugs, refactoring code).
*   **Runbooks:** Maintain and create runbooks for common issues.

## 5. Communication During Incidents

*   **Internal Communication:** Keep the incident response team and stakeholders updated on the status and progress.
*   **External Communication:** (Managed by Incident Commander/Communications Lead) Communicate impact and resolution to affected users and customers.

## 6. Post-Incident Review (Postmortem)

Every significant incident will undergo a post-incident review (postmortem). This is a blameless process focused on learning and improving.

*   **Key Questions:**
    *   What happened?
    *   Why did it happen?
    *   What was the impact?
    *   How did we respond?
    *   What went well?
    *   What could be improved?
    *   What action items will we take?

By following these guidelines, developers play a crucial role in maintaining the stability and reliability of our services.
