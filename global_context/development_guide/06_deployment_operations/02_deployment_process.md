# Deployment Process

This document details the process for deploying the PCW application across different environments, focusing on ease of deployment, consistency, and reliability. Our deployment strategy is designed to facilitate quick, automated, and safe releases.

## 1. Deployment Environments

We maintain several distinct deployment environments:
*   **Development (Dev):** Individual developer local machines (see [Local Development Setup](../../02_getting_started/02_local_development_setup.md)).
*   **Development Integration (DevInt):** A shared environment for integrating and testing features from multiple development branches. Often volatile.
*   **Quality Assurance (QA):** Environment for formal QA testing, bug reproduction, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
*   **Staging (Pre-Production):** A near-replica of the production environment used for final testing, performance tuning, and stakeholder review before production release.
*   **Production (Prod):** The live customer-facing environment.

## 2. Core Principles for Easy Deployment

*   **Automation First:** All deployment steps are automated via CI/CD pipelines. Manual intervention is minimized.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** All infrastructure (servers, databases, network configurations) is defined and managed using code (Terraform). This ensures environment consistency and reproducibility.
*   **Containerization:** Applications are packaged as Docker containers, ensuring they run consistently across all environments.
*   **Configuration Management:** Separate configurations for each environment are managed securely (e.g., using AWS Secrets Manager, Kubernetes Secrets, external configuration services).
*   **Declarative Deployments:** Using tools like Kubernetes (EKS) or AWS ECS to describe the desired state, allowing the system to reconcile differences.

## 3. Deployment Workflow

1.  **Code Commit & CI:** Developer commits code, triggering the CI pipeline (build, test, scan).
2.  **Image Build:** Upon successful CI, Docker images are built and pushed to a container registry (e.g., AWS ECR). Images are tagged with commit SHAs or version numbers.
3.  **Deployment to Staging (Automated):**
    *   A successful build and container image push automatically triggers deployment to the Staging environment.
    *   New versions are typically deployed using **Blue/Green** or **Canary** deployment strategies to minimize risk (see below).
    *   Automated tests (E2E, performance) run against the Staging environment.
4.  **Manual Approval for Production:** After successful testing on Staging and stakeholder sign-off, a manual approval step is required in the CI/CD pipeline to proceed to Production.
5.  **Deployment to Production (Automated):**
    *   The approved version is automatically deployed to the Production environment, again using Blue/Green or Canary strategies.
    *   Post-deployment smoke tests are executed.
6.  **Monitoring & Rollback:** Continuous monitoring in production. If issues are detected, a quick rollback to the previous stable version is initiated.

## 4. Deployment Strategies

*   **Blue/Green Deployment:**
    *   Run two identical production environments (Blue and Green).
    *   Deploy the new version to the inactive (e.g., Green) environment and thoroughly test it.
    *   Once validated, switch traffic from Blue to Green. Fast rollback by switching traffic back to Blue.
*   **Canary Deployment:**
    *   Deploy the new version (Canary) to a small subset of servers/users.
    *   Monitor its performance and stability with real traffic.
    *   If stable, gradually roll out to more servers/users. If issues, quickly rollback the Canary.

## 5. Configuration Management (for Multi-Environment Deployments)

*   **Externalized Configuration:** Configuration parameters (database connection strings, API keys, service endpoints) are externalized from the application code.
*   **Environment Variables:** Runtime configuration is primarily provided via environment variables.
*   **Centralized Secrets Management:** Use dedicated services like AWS Secrets Manager or Kubernetes Secrets to store and manage sensitive environment-specific configurations.
*   **No Hardcoded Values:** Never hardcode environment-specific values in the codebase.

By following these practices, we ensure that our application can be deployed consistently and reliably across all environments, from development to production.
