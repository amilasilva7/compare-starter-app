# Performance & Scalability Strategy

This document outlines the key strategies for ensuring the application is performant, responsive, and capable of scaling to meet user demand.

## 1. Horizontal Scaling

The microservices architecture is the foundation of our scaling strategy. Because each service is independent, we can scale them individually based on their specific load.

*   **Containerization:** All services are packaged as Docker containers.
*   **Orchestration:** A container orchestrator (e.g., Kubernetes, AWS ECS) is used to manage the services. It will be configured to automatically scale the number of running instances of a service up or down based on real-time metrics like CPU utilization or request count.

## 2. Caching

Caching is employed aggressively at multiple layers to reduce latency and decrease the load on backend systems.

*   **CDN (Content Delivery Network):** A CDN (e.g., AWS CloudFront, Cloudflare) is used to cache static frontend assets (JavaScript, CSS, images) at edge locations close to the user. This dramatically reduces initial page load times.
*   **Distributed Backend Cache:** A distributed in-memory cache (e.g., **Redis**) is used by all microservices to store the results of frequent or expensive operations, such as database queries. This significantly reduces the load on the primary databases.

## 3. Asynchronous Processing

To ensure the user interface remains fast and responsive, any long-running or non-critical tasks are offloaded to be processed asynchronously.

*   **Message Broker:** **Apache Kafka** is used to manage these background tasks. For example, when a user requests a report that takes time to generate, the request is published as an event to Kafka. A separate worker service processes the event and notifies the user when the report is ready, without making the user wait for the initial request to complete.

## 4. Efficient Communication & Databases

*   **Lightweight Protocols:** For internal service-to-service communication where performance is critical, lightweight protocols like gRPC may be used in addition to REST.
*   **Database Optimization:** All database queries are optimized, and proper indexing is enforced to ensure fast retrieval of data. For services with very high read traffic, database read replicas may be used to distribute the load.
