# Monitoring & Logging

Effective monitoring and logging are crucial for understanding the health, performance, and behavior of the PCW application, enabling proactive issue detection and rapid incident resolution.

## 1. Monitoring Strategy

Our monitoring strategy focuses on the 'Four Golden Signals' of monitoring:
*   **Latency:** The time it takes to serve a request or complete an action.
*   **Traffic:** How much demand is being placed on your system (e.g., requests per second).
*   **Errors:** The rate of requests that fail (e.g., HTTP 5xx errors).
*   **Saturation:** How 'full' your service is (e.g., CPU, memory, disk, network utilization).

### a. Key Monitoring Tools
*   **Prometheus:** For collecting and storing time-series metrics from all services.
*   **Grafana:** For creating dashboards and visualizing metrics from Prometheus.
*   **Cloud Provider Monitoring (e.g., AWS CloudWatch):** For infrastructure-level metrics and health checks.
*   **Application Performance Monitoring (APM) Tool (e.g., New Relic, Datadog):** For deep visibility into application code performance, transaction tracing, and dependency mapping.

### b. Alerting
*   Set up alerts in Prometheus Alertmanager or CloudWatch based on predefined thresholds for key metrics.
*   Alerts should be actionable, routed to the appropriate teams (e.g., PagerDuty, Slack channels), and include sufficient context for diagnosis.

## 2. Logging Strategy

We ensure comprehensive and consistent logging across all application components.

### a. Logging Principles
*   **Structured Logging:** Emit logs in a structured format (e.g., JSON) to facilitate parsing, searching, and analysis.
*   **Contextual Information:** Include relevant context in logs, such as `request_id`, `user_id` (anonymized), `service_name`, `trace_id`, `environment`, `timestamp`.
*   **Severity Levels:** Use standard logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) appropriately.
*   **Avoid PII in Logs:** Never log Personally Identifiable Information (PII) unless absolutely necessary for auditing/compliance and with strict security controls.
*   **Centralized Logging:** Aggregate logs from all services into a central logging system.

### b. Key Logging Tools
*   **ELK Stack:** Elasticsearch (for storage and indexing), Logstash (for parsing and transforming), Kibana (for visualization and searching).
*   **Cloud Provider Logging (e.g., AWS CloudWatch Logs):** For collecting and storing logs, especially from serverless functions or managed services.

## 3. Distributed Tracing

For microservices architectures, distributed tracing is essential to understand the flow of requests across multiple services and identify performance bottlenecks.

*   **Tools:** Jaeger, OpenTelemetry, AWS X-Ray.
*   **Implementation:** Ensure all services propagate trace context (e.g., `trace_id`, `span_id`) through requests.

## 4. Error Tracking

Integrate error tracking tools to automatically capture and report application errors, enabling quick diagnosis and resolution.

*   **Tools:** Sentry, Rollbar.

Effective monitoring and logging are indispensable for maintaining a highly available, performant, and secure PCW application.
