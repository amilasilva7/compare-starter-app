# Monitoring & Logging Strategy

In a distributed microservices architecture, effective monitoring and logging are crucial for understanding system health, diagnosing issues, and ensuring reliability. Our strategy is built on the three pillars of observability: Logs, Metrics, and Traces.

## 1. Centralized Logging

*   **What it is:** The process of collecting logs from all services into a single, searchable location.
*   **Strategy:**
    *   All microservices will write logs to `stdout` as a stream of events.
    *   A log aggregator agent (e.g., Fluentd, Filebeat) running alongside our services will collect these logs.
    *   Logs are forwarded to a centralized logging platform.
*   **Recommended Tools:**
    *   **Platform:** **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** or a managed cloud service like Datadog Logs or AWS CloudWatch Logs.

## 2. Metrics & Alerting

*   **What it is:** The collection of time-series data representing the quantitative health and performance of the system (e.g., CPU usage, request rates, error counts).
*   **Strategy:**
    *   Each microservice will expose a `/metrics` endpoint with key performance indicators.
    *   A central tool will periodically scrape these endpoints to collect the metrics.
    *   Dashboards will be built to visualize system health, and alerts will be configured to automatically notify the team of any anomalies (e.g., error rate exceeds 5%).
*   **Recommended Tools:**
    *   **Metrics Collection:** **Prometheus**
    *   **Visualization & Alerting:** **Grafana**

## 3. Distributed Tracing

*   **What it is:** A method for tracking the entire lifecycle of a request as it travels through multiple microservices. This is essential for debugging bottlenecks and errors in a distributed system.
*   **Strategy:**
    *   When a request first enters the system (at the BFF), it is assigned a unique **Trace ID**.
    *   This Trace ID is passed in the headers of every subsequent internal request to other services.
    *   By correlating logs and events using this Trace ID, we can reconstruct the entire journey of a single request.
*   **Recommended Tools:**
    *   **Instrumentation:** **OpenTelemetry** (a vendor-neutral standard for generating trace data).
    *   **Backend/Visualization:** **Jaeger** or a managed cloud service like Datadog APM or AWS X-Ray.
