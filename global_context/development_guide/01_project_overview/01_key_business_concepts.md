# Key Business Concepts

This document aims to explain the core business concepts relevant to the UK Price Comparison Website (PCW) in simple, non-technical terms. Understanding these concepts is crucial for all team members, regardless of their technical background, to ensure alignment with project goals and user needs.

## 1. Price Comparison Website (PCW)

A PCW is an online platform that allows consumers to compare prices and features of various products or services from multiple providers simultaneously. For our project, this primarily includes financial products like insurance, loans, and utilities.

## 2. Managing General Agent (MGA) Model

Many of the brands we compare, and even our own platform, operate under an MGA model. This means:
*   **The Brand (MGA):** The company you interact with (e.g., MoneySuperMarket, GoCompare, or our PCW) that designs, markets, sells, and administers insurance policies.
*   **The Underwriter (Carrier):** A separate, often larger, insurance company that actually assumes the financial risk of the policy and pays out claims. The MGA acts on behalf of the underwriter.

## 3. Policy Types (Examples)

*   **Lifetime Insurance:** Policies that cover a pet (or other insured item) for its entire life, renewing annually. This is common in pet insurance.
*   **Pre-existing Conditions:** Health issues that existed before an insurance policy started. Coverage for these is a key differentiator for many providers.
*   **Excess:** The amount of money you have to pay towards a claim before the insurance company pays the rest.

## 4. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Common metrics used to measure the success of a PCW:
*   **Conversion Rate:** The percentage of users who complete a comparison and then purchase a product.
*   **Traffic:** The number of visitors to the website.
*   **Commission Revenue:** Earnings from successful referrals.
*   **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV):** The total revenue a business expects to earn from a customer over their relationship.

## 5. Regulatory Bodies

*   **Financial Conduct Authority (FCA):** The regulatory body for financial services firms and financial markets in the UK. Ensures fair and transparent practices.
*   **Information Commissioner's Office (ICO):** The UK's independent authority set up to uphold information rights in the public interest, promoting openness by public bodies and data privacy for individuals (relevant for GDPR).

Understanding these concepts will help you grasp the 'why' behind many of our technical and design decisions.
