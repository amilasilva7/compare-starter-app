# Getting Help & Escalation

This document outlines the channels and procedures for getting help, reporting issues, and escalating problems within the PCW application development team.

## 1. Where to Ask Questions

*   **Team Chat (e.g., Slack/Teams Channel: `#pcw-dev`):** For quick questions, general discussions, and sharing progress. This is the first place to ask for help.
*   **Daily Stand-ups:** Bring up blockers or questions during the daily stand-up meeting.
*   **Code Reviews:** Use the Pull Request review process for specific code-related questions or design discussions.
*   **Internal Wiki/Confluence:** For searching existing documentation or solutions.

## 2. Reporting Bugs & Issues

*   **Project Management Tool (e.g., Jira, Asana):** All bugs, issues, and feature requests should be logged in our designated project management tool.
*   **Bug Report Template:** When reporting a bug, ensure you include:
    *   Clear, concise title.
    *   Steps to reproduce.
    *   Expected behavior.
    *   Actual behavior.
    *   Screenshots or video recordings (if applicable).
    *   Environment details (OS, browser, service version).
    *   Relevant logs or error messages.

## 3. Escalation Paths

If you are blocked or an issue requires immediate attention, follow these escalation paths:

### a. Technical Blockers
1.  **Team Chat:** Ask in the `#pcw-dev` channel. Often, a teammate can provide a quick solution.
2.  **Pair Programming:** Request a pair programming session with a more experienced team member.
3.  **Team Lead/Senior Developer:** If still blocked after a reasonable attempt (e.g., 1-2 hours), escalate to your team lead or a designated senior developer.

### b. Production Incidents
*   **Severity 1/2 Incidents:** Follow the [Incident Response Workflow](../../06_deployment_operations/04_incident_response_role.md).
    *   Immediately notify the on-call engineer or Incident Commander.
    *   Do NOT attempt to fix critical production issues without coordination.
*   **Severity 3/4 Incidents:** Report in the `#pcw-dev` channel and create a ticket in the project management tool. The on-call engineer or relevant service owner will pick it up.

### c. Security Concerns
*   If you discover a potential security vulnerability or have a security concern, immediately contact the Security Lead or your Team Lead. Do NOT disclose the vulnerability publicly or attempt to fix it without guidance.

## 4. Feedback & Suggestions

*   **Retrospectives:** Share feedback and suggestions during sprint retrospectives.
*   **Dedicated Channels:** Use specific Slack/Teams channels for feedback on tools, processes, or documentation.

Remember, asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. We are a team, and collaboration is key to our success.
