# AI Security Considerations

As our PCW application increasingly leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) for personalization, predictive analytics, and conversational interfaces, it introduces unique security and ethical challenges. This document outlines best practices for developing and deploying AI-driven features securely and responsibly.

## 1. Data Security for AI Models
*   **Sensitive Data Protection:** Ensure all data used for training, testing, and operating AI models (especially PII) is protected with the same rigor as other sensitive data (encryption, access control, anonymization/pseudonymization).
*   **Data Poisoning Prevention:** Implement robust input validation and anomaly detection to prevent malicious actors from contaminating training data, which could lead to biased or insecure model behavior.
*   **Model Inversion Attacks:** Be aware of the risk that an attacker could deduce sensitive information from the model's outputs. Mitigate this through careful model design and output anonymization where necessary.

## 2. Model Integrity & Robustness
*   **Model Evasion Attacks:** Design models to be robust against adversarial examples that try to trick the model into making incorrect predictions (e.g., slightly altered inputs that change a classification).
*   **Model Drift Detection:** Continuously monitor model performance in production to detect drift, which could indicate data quality issues, changes in user behavior, or potential attacks compromising model integrity.
*   **Secure Model Deployment:** Protect AI models themselves from tampering during deployment and operation. Store model weights/parameters securely.

## 3. Ethical AI & Bias Mitigation
*   **Bias Detection & Mitigation:** Actively test and develop strategies to identify and mitigate biases in training data and model decisions, especially concerning user personalization, pricing, or recommendations, to ensure fair outcomes for all users.
*   **Transparency & Explainability (XAI):** Where feasible and relevant, ensure AI decisions are explainable to users and regulators. This builds trust and aids debugging.
*   **Fairness & Non-Discrimination:** Design AI systems to promote fairness and avoid discrimination, particularly in areas like credit scoring or insurance recommendations.

## 4. AI-Specific Access Control
*   Implement strict access control to AI models, training data, inference APIs, and model management platforms.
*   Ensure that only authorized personnel and services can interact with these components.

## 5. Continuous Monitoring & Auditing
*   **AI-Specific Logging:** Implement logging for AI model inputs, outputs, and decisions (while respecting privacy) to enable auditing and debubbing.
*   **Performance Monitoring:** Beyond standard application metrics, monitor AI model-specific metrics (e.g., prediction accuracy, latency, resource usage).

## 6. Regulatory Compliance
*   Stay updated on evolving AI regulations (e.g., EU AI Act, UK government's AI principles) and ensure the application's AI features remain compliant.

By integrating these considerations, we aim to build AI capabilities that are not only powerful but also trustworthy, secure, and ethical.
