# Security Strategy Overview

This document outlines the multi-layered security strategy for our microservices-based architecture. The goal is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our systems and user data.

## 1. Authentication & Authorization

*   **BFF as Gatekeeper:** The Web App BFF serves as the primary authentication gateway. It is responsible for validating user credentials and/or tokens (e.g., JWTs) for every incoming request from a client application.
*   **Centralized User Data:** The `Users Service` is the single source of truth for user profiles, roles, and permissions.
*   **Service-to-Service Security:** Once a user is authenticated at the BFF, their identity and permissions are securely propagated to downstream services with each request. All internal service-to-service calls must also be secured (e.g., via mTLS or scoped access tokens) to prevent unauthorized internal access.

## 2. Network Security

*   **Private Network (VPC):** All core microservices and databases operate within a private cloud network (Virtual Private Cloud). They are not directly accessible from the public internet.
*   **Controlled Ingress/Egress:** Only the BFFs and other designated public-facing gateways are exposed to the internet. All other traffic is denied by default.
*   **Firewall Rules:** Strict network security rules (e.g., AWS Security Groups) are used to control traffic between services. For example, only the `Users Service` is permitted to establish a connection with the user database.

## 3. Data Security

*   **Encryption in Transit:** All communication is encrypted using TLS. This includes external traffic between the user and the BFF (HTTPS) and internal traffic between services.
*   **Encryption at Rest:** All data stored in databases, caches, and object storage is encrypted at rest.
*   **Secrets Management:** A dedicated secrets management tool (e.g., HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager) is used to store and manage all sensitive credentials like API keys, database passwords, and signing certificates. Secrets are never hardcoded in the application source code.

## 4. Vulnerability Management

*   **Dependency Scanning:** Automated tools are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to continuously scan all third-party libraries and dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
*   **Static & Dynamic Analysis (SAST/DAST):** Code is automatically analyzed for security vulnerabilities as part of the development workflow.
