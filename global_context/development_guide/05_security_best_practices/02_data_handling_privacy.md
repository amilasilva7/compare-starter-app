# Data Handling & Privacy (PII & GDPR)

Protecting user data and ensuring privacy is a core responsibility for our PCW application. This document outlines best practices for handling Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and maintaining GDPR compliance.

## 1. Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

PII is any data that could potentially identify a specific individual. Examples include:
*   Name, address, email, phone number
*   Date of birth, national insurance number
*   Vehicle registration, policy numbers
*   IP addresses, device IDs (under certain contexts)

### a. Principles for Handling PII
*   **Data Minimization:** Only collect the minimum amount of PII necessary for a specific purpose. *If you don't need it, don't collect it.*
*   **Purpose Limitation:** Use PII only for the purpose for which it was collected and with user consent.
*   **Storage Limitation:** Retain PII only for as long as necessary for the stated purpose or legal/regulatory requirements. Implement automated deletion policies.
*   **Accuracy:** Ensure PII is accurate and up-to-date.

### b. PII Protection Measures
*   **Encryption at Rest & In Transit:**
    *   All PII stored in databases, file systems, and backups must be encrypted.
    *   All communication involving PII (e.g., between frontend and backend, APIs) must use strong TLS/HTTPS encryption.
*   **Access Control:** Strictly limit access to PII based on the principle of least privilege (only those who *need* access to *perform their job* should have it).
*   **Pseudonymization/Anonymization:** Where possible, pseudonymize or anonymize PII for analytics, testing, and development environments. *Never use real customer PII in non-production environments.*
*   **Secure Logging:** Avoid logging PII in application logs unless absolutely necessary and ensure logs are secured and rotated.

## 2. GDPR Compliance (General Data Protection Regulation)

GDPR is a comprehensive data protection law in the UK and EU. Our application must be fully compliant.

### a. Key GDPR Principles for Developers
*   **Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency:** Process data lawfully, fairly, and transparently in relation to the data subject.
*   **Data Minimization:** (See above) Collect only what is necessary.
*   **Accuracy:** Take reasonable steps to ensure data is accurate.
*   **Storage Limitation:** (See above) Retain data only as long as needed.
*   **Integrity and Confidentiality:** Protect personal data from unauthorized processing, accidental loss, destruction, or damage using appropriate technical and organizational measures.
*   **Accountability:** Be able to demonstrate compliance.

### b. Data Subject Rights (Implement these features):
*   **Right to Access:** Provide users with clear ways to access their personal data held by us (e.g., via their account portal).
*   **Right to Rectification:** Allow users to correct inaccurate personal data.
*   **Right to Erasure ("Right to be Forgotten"):** Implement processes for users to request deletion of their personal data.
*   **Right to Restriction of Processing:** Allow users to limit how their data is processed.
*   **Right to Data Portability:** Enable users to receive their personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.
*   **Right to Object:** Provide mechanisms for users to object to certain types of data processing.

### c. Consent Management
*   **Explicit Consent:** For non-essential data processing (e.g., marketing, non-essential cookies), obtain clear, affirmative consent from users.
*   **Consent Management Platform (CMP):** Implement a robust CMP to manage user consent preferences (e.g., for cookies) and record consent decisions.

## 3. Regular Audits & Training
*   Participate in regular security and privacy training.
*   Be aware of new privacy regulations and best practices.

By adhering to these guidelines, we uphold our commitment to user privacy and regulatory compliance.
