# Authentication & Authorization Implementation

This document details the standards and best practices for implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms across the PCW application.

## 1. Authentication (Verifying Identity)

Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity. Our application requires robust authentication for all user types.

### a. Password Management
*   **Strong Hashing:** Always store passwords as secure one-way hashes (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2). Never store plaintext passwords.
*   **Salting:** Use a unique salt for each password to protect against rainbow table attacks.
*   **Rate Limiting Login Attempts:** Implement mechanisms to slow down or temporarily block login attempts from a single IP address or username to prevent brute-force attacks.
*   **Account Lockout:** Temporarily lock user accounts after a predefined number of failed login attempts.
*   **Secure Password Reset:** Implement a secure password reset process (e.g., time-limited tokens sent to verified email/phone) that does not expose sensitive information.

### b. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
*   **Mandatory for Internal/Admin Roles:** MFA (e.g., TOTP, FIDO2, SMS) is mandatory for Administrator, Provider/Partner, Affiliate, and Data Analyst roles.
*   **Optional for Customers (Strongly Encouraged):** Offer MFA as an option for customers, highly recommending it for enhanced security, especially for sensitive actions.

### c. Session Management
*   **Secure Session Tokens:** Generate long, random, and cryptographically secure session tokens for authenticated users.
*   **HTTP-Only & Secure Cookies:** Store session tokens in HTTP-only and secure (HTTPS-only) cookies to mitigate XSS attacks.
*   **Appropriate Session Timeouts:** Implement reasonable session timeouts based on risk level (shorter for high-privilege users, longer for general customers).
*   **Session Invalidation:** Ensure sessions are immediately invalidated upon logout, password change, or forced termination.

### d. Single Sign-On (SSO)
*   For internal staff and potentially for certain provider integrations, leverage secure SSO solutions (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect) to centralize identity management and improve user experience.

### e. Third-Party Application Authentication
*   **API Keys/OAuth 2.0:** For third-party applications (e.g., provider systems, affiliate platforms), use secure authentication mechanisms like unique API keys (managed via the Admin Dashboard) or OAuth 2.0 flows for delegated access.
*   **Credential Rotation:** Implement a policy for regular rotation of API keys and other third-party credentials.

## 2. Authorization (Controlling Access)

Authorization is the process of determining what an authenticated user is permitted to do. This must be implemented at every layer of the application.

### a. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
*   **Define Roles:** Clearly define roles such as `customer`, `provider_admin`, `affiliate_manager`, `internal_support`, `data_analyst_read_only`, `super_admin`.
*   **Assign Permissions:** Assign specific granular permissions to each role (e.g., `can_view_quotes`, `can_update_product_data`, `can_manage_users`).
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Users (and services) should only be granted the minimum permissions necessary to perform their required functions.

### b. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
*   For more dynamic and fine-grained access control, explore ABAC. This involves making access decisions based on attributes of:
    *   **User:** (e.g., department, location, security clearance)
    *   **Resource:** (e.g., type of data, sensitivity level, owner)
    *   **Environment:** (e.g., time of day, IP address)
*   **Example:** A provider admin can only modify products belonging to their own company.

### c. Authorization Enforcement
*   **Server-Side Validation:** All authorization checks must be performed on the server-side, never solely relying on client-side controls.
*   **API Gateway & Service Layer Enforcement:** Implement authorization checks at the API Gateway (for initial screening) and within individual microservices (for granular, business-logic-driven checks).
*   **Secure API Endpoints:** Every API endpoint must have explicit authorization rules applied.

### d. Third-Party Application Authorization
*   **Granular Permissions:** Ensure that third-party applications are granted only the specific, granular permissions required for their integration, adhering strictly to the principle of least privilege.
*   **Scope Management:** For OAuth 2.0, clearly define and enforce scopes to limit the access a third-party application has to user data or functionality.

By rigorously implementing these authentication and authorization measures, we ensure that only legitimate users and authorized third-party applications can access the application and only perform actions for which they are explicitly permitted.
