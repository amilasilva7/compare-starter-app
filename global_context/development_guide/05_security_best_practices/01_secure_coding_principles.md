# Secure Coding Principles

This document outlines fundamental secure coding principles that all developers must follow to prevent common vulnerabilities in the PCW application.

## 1. OWASP Top 10

Familiarize yourself with the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10/), which represents the most critical web application security risks. Always code with these in mind.

## 2. Input Validation & Output Encoding
*   **Validate Everything:** Never trust user input, external API responses, or data retrieved from databases. Validate all input at every trust boundary (e.g., UI, API Gateway, service boundaries).
    *   **Syntax Validation:** Ensure data conforms to expected format (e.g., email address, numeric values, date formats).
    *   **Semantic Validation:** Ensure data makes business sense (e.g., minimum/maximum values, logical consistency).
*   **Output Encoding:** Always encode data that is rendered in HTML, JavaScript, or other contexts to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

## 3. Injection Flaws
*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) for all database interactions. Never concatenate user input directly into SQL queries.
*   **Command Injection:** Avoid running system commands with user-supplied input. If absolutely necessary, strictly sanitize and validate inputs, and consider using safer alternatives.

## 4. Broken Access Control
*   Implement robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) at all layers of the application (API endpoints, service methods, UI elements).
*   Ensure that users can only access resources and perform actions for which they are explicitly authorized.

## 5. Security Misconfiguration
*   **Least Privilege:** Configure all components (servers, databases, services) with the minimum necessary privileges.
*   **Disable Unused Features:** Turn off or remove unnecessary services, ports, and functionalities.
*   **Secure Defaults:** Do not use default credentials. Change default passwords immediately.
*   **Error Handling:** Provide generic error messages. Do not leak sensitive system information (e.g., stack traces, database errors) to users.

## 6. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Contextual Output Encoding:** Encode all untrusted data before it is rendered in HTML, JavaScript, URL, or CSS contexts.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to whitelist trusted sources of content and prevent browsers from executing malicious scripts.

## 7. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
*   Implement CSRF tokens for all state-changing HTTP requests (POST, PUT, DELETE).
*   Ensure tokens are unique per user session and validated on the server-side.

## 8. Secure Data Transmission
*   Always use HTTPS/TLS for all communication (see [Data Handling & Privacy](../02_data_handling_privacy.md)).

## 9. Dependency Management
*   Regularly scan and update third-party libraries and dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Use dependency scanning tools in your CI/CD pipeline.

## 10. Logging and Monitoring
*   Log security-relevant events, failed login attempts, access violations.
*   Monitor logs for suspicious activity and integrate with SIEM solutions (see [Monitoring & Logging](../../06_deployment_operations/03_monitoring_logging.md)).

## 11. Error Handling
*   Implement robust error handling that logs errors securely without exposing sensitive information to users.
*   Provide generic error messages to end-users.

## 12. Third-Party Access Security

When integrating with or providing access to third-party applications (e.g., partners, affiliates), specific security measures must be implemented:

*   **API Key Management:** Issue unique, revocable API keys for each third-party integration.
*   **IP Whitelisting:** Implement IP whitelisting at the API Gateway or network level to restrict access to known, trusted IP addresses of third-party applications. This whitelisting must be configurable via the Admin Dashboard.
*   **Least Privilege:** Grant third-party applications only the minimum necessary permissions to perform their required functions.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Apply strict rate limiting to third-party API access to prevent abuse.
*   **Secure Callbacks/Webhooks:** If third parties send data back to our application via webhooks, ensure these endpoints are secured with signature verification or other authentication mechanisms.
*   **Regular Audits:** Periodically review and audit third-party access configurations and usage.

By consistently applying these principles, we can build a resilient and secure PCW application.
