# Provider Integration Guide

Integrating with external providers (insurance companies, utility companies, financial institutions) is a core function of our PCW application. This guide outlines the process, best practices, and considerations for building and maintaining these integrations.

## 1. Integration Process Overview

1.  **Discovery & API Review:** Understand the provider's API capabilities, documentation, and data models.
2.  **Data Mapping:** Map provider-specific data fields to our internal standardized data model.
3.  **API Client Development:** Develop a robust and fault-tolerant client for interacting with the provider's API.
4.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test the integration (unit, integration, E2E) with various scenarios, including edge cases and error conditions.
5.  **Deployment:** Deploy the integration service to the appropriate environment.
6.  **Monitoring:** Set up specific monitoring and alerting for the integration's health and performance.

## 2. Key Considerations for Provider Integrations

### a. Standardized Data Models
*   **Internal Data Model:** All incoming data from providers must be transformed into our internal, standardized data model. This ensures consistency across the platform and simplifies downstream processing.
*   **Data Mapping:** Maintain clear and versioned data mapping specifications for each provider.

### b. API Client Development Best Practices
*   **Resilience:** Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for transient errors.
*   **Timeouts:** Configure appropriate connection and read timeouts to prevent integrations from hanging indefinitely.
*   **Circuit Breakers:** Use circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures when a provider's API is unresponsive.
*   **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle provider API errors, logging details and providing meaningful fallback responses to users where possible.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Respect provider-specific API rate limits to avoid being blocked.
*   **Authentication:** Securely manage API keys or OAuth tokens for provider authentication.

### c. Data Transformation & Validation
*   **Input Validation:** Strictly validate all data received from provider APIs before processing.
*   **Data Cleansing:** Implement logic to clean and normalize provider data to fit our internal standards.
*   **Schema Validation:** Use tools to validate incoming data against expected schemas.

### d. Monitoring & Alerting
*   **Integration-Specific Metrics:** Monitor key metrics for each integration:
    *   API call success/failure rates.
    *   Response times.
    *   Number of quotes returned.
    *   Data parsing errors.
*   **Alerting:** Set up alerts for significant deviations in these metrics (e.g., sudden drop in success rate, increased latency).

### e. Versioning & Deprecation
*   **Provider API Versioning:** Be aware of and plan for provider API version changes. Implement strategies to support multiple versions if necessary.
*   **Our API Versioning:** Ensure our internal services that consume provider APIs are designed to be resilient to minor changes and have a clear strategy for major version upgrades.

### f. Security
*   **Secure Credential Storage:** Store provider API keys and secrets securely (e.g., in a secrets manager, not in code).
*   **IP Whitelisting:** Where possible, restrict provider API access to our known IP addresses.

## 3. Onboarding New Providers

*   **Self-Service Portal:** Develop a portal for providers to manage their integration details, API keys, and product data.
*   **Documentation:** Provide clear, comprehensive documentation for providers on how to integrate with our platform.

By following these guidelines, we can build robust, reliable, and scalable integrations with our diverse set of providers.
