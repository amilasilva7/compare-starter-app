# Data Quality & Governance

Ensuring high data quality and robust data governance is critical for the accuracy of comparisons, the effectiveness of AI models, regulatory compliance, and overall trust in our PCW application. This document outlines our approach to data quality and governance.

## 1. Data Quality Principles

*   **Accuracy:** Data must be correct and reflect reality.
*   **Completeness:** All required data fields must be populated.
*   **Consistency:** Data should be consistent across different systems and over time.
*   **Timeliness:** Data must be available and up-to-date when needed.
*   **Validity:** Data must conform to defined formats, types, and business rules.
*   **Uniqueness:** Avoid duplicate records where a unique identifier is expected.

## 2. Data Governance Framework

Data governance establishes the policies, processes, and responsibilities for managing data assets. Key aspects include:

*   **Data Ownership:** Clearly define who is responsible for the quality and integrity of specific data sets.
*   **Data Definitions:** Maintain a central glossary of business terms and data definitions to ensure common understanding.
*   **Data Lifecycle Management:** Define policies for data creation, storage, usage, retention, and deletion (see [Data Handling & Privacy](../../05_security_best_practices/02_data_handling_privacy.md)).
*   **Access Control:** Implement strict access controls based on roles and data sensitivity.

## 3. Data Validation

*   **Input Validation:** Implement robust validation at the point of data entry (frontend and API layer) to prevent invalid data from entering the system.
*   **Schema Validation:** Use database constraints, ORM validations, and API schema definitions (e.g., OpenAPI) to enforce data structure and type.
*   **Business Rule Validation:** Implement business logic to validate data against complex business rules (e.g., an insurance premium cannot be negative).

## 4. Data Monitoring & Profiling

*   **Automated Data Quality Checks:** Implement automated jobs to regularly check data for anomalies, inconsistencies, and violations of business rules.
*   **Data Profiling:** Periodically analyze data to understand its structure, content, and quality characteristics.
*   **Alerting:** Set up alerts for significant data quality issues (e.g., a sudden drop in completeness for a critical field).

## 5. Data Cleansing & Enrichment

*   **Data Cleansing Processes:** Establish processes for identifying and correcting inaccurate, incomplete, or inconsistent data.
*   **Data Enrichment:** Where appropriate, use external data sources to enrich existing data (e.g., address validation, vehicle lookup).

## 6. Data Versioning

*   For critical data, consider implementing versioning to track changes over time, allowing for auditing and rollback if necessary.

## 7. Data Security & Privacy

*   Adhere strictly to the guidelines outlined in [Data Handling & Privacy](../../05_security_best_practices/02_data_handling_privacy.md) and [Security Access Considerations](../../06_security_access_considerations/README.md).

By prioritizing data quality and implementing strong governance, we ensure that our PCW application operates on reliable information, leading to accurate comparisons, effective personalization, and trusted insights.
