# Data Migration Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for managing database schema changes and data migrations within the PCW application. A robust migration strategy is essential for evolving the application while maintaining data integrity and minimizing downtime.

## 1. Principles

*   **Automated:** All schema changes and data migrations must be automated and version-controlled.
*   **Idempotent:** Migrations should be executable multiple times without causing unintended side effects.
*   **Reversible (where possible):** While not always feasible for complex data transformations, strive to make migrations reversible or have a clear rollback plan.
*   **Atomic:** Each migration should represent a single, logical change.
*   **Tested:** Migrations must be thoroughly tested in non-production environments.

## 2. Migration Tools

We will use language/framework-specific migration tools:
*   **Python (Django/FastAPI):** `Alembic` (for SQLAlchemy) or Django's built-in migration system.
*   **Go:** `Goose` or `migrate`.
*   **Node.js (TypeScript):** `TypeORM Migrations` or `Knex.js`.

## 3. Types of Migrations

*   **Schema Migrations:** Changes to the database structure (e.g., adding/dropping tables, columns, indexes, altering data types).
*   **Data Migrations:** Changes to the data itself (e.g., populating new columns, transforming existing data, cleaning up old data).

## 4. Migration Workflow

1.  **Develop Migration:** Write the migration script using the chosen tool. This script should define both `up` (apply) and `down` (rollback) operations.
2.  **Test Locally:** Apply the migration in your local development environment and verify its effects. Test both `up` and `down` operations if reversible.
3.  **Version Control:** Commit the migration script to version control alongside the code changes it supports.
4.  **CI/CD Integration:** Migrations are typically applied automatically as part of the deployment pipeline to non-production environments (DevInt, QA, Staging).
5.  **Production Deployment:** For production, migrations are applied carefully, often as a separate step or with specific strategies (see below).

## 5. Production Migration Strategies

For critical production environments, especially with large datasets, consider these strategies to minimize downtime:

*   **Zero-Downtime Migrations:**
    *   **Additive Changes First:** Always add new columns, tables, or indexes before removing old ones. This allows the old and new versions of the application to run simultaneously.
    *   **Two-Phase Deployment:**
        1.  Deploy code that can work with both the old and new schema.
        2.  Apply the schema migration.
        3.  Deploy code that only works with the new schema.
    *   **Feature Flags:** Use feature flags to control the activation of new code paths that depend on schema changes.
*   **Blue/Green or Canary Deployments:** (See [Deployment Process](../../06_deployment_operations/02_deployment_process.md)) These strategies can help manage the risk of migrations by allowing a gradual rollout or quick rollback.

## 6. Data Seeding

*   **Initial Data:** Use migration scripts or separate seeding scripts to populate initial data (e.g., lookup tables, default configurations) in new environments.
*   **Test Data:** Never use production data for testing. Generate realistic, anonymized test data for development and QA environments.

By following a disciplined data migration strategy, we can ensure the continuous evolution of our application's data model without compromising data integrity or service availability.
