# Data Migration Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for managing database schema and data changes in our MongoDB instance. While MongoDB is schema-flexible, managing changes to data structures and types, as well as migrating existing data, is crucial for application stability and data integrity.

---

### **1. Tooling: `migrate-mongo`**

We will use **`migrate-mongo`** as our primary database migration tool for the Node.js/MongoDB stack.

*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Version Control:** Migrations are defined in JavaScript files and stored alongside our application code, allowing for version control and traceability.
    *   **Up/Down Functions:** Each migration script contains both an `up()` function (to apply the change) and a `down()` function (to revert the change), enabling forward and backward compatibility.
    *   **Changelog Tracking:** `migrate-mongo` maintains a `_changelog` collection in MongoDB to track which migrations have been applied, preventing redundant execution.
    *   **Environment Agnostic:** Can be run against any MongoDB instance, making it suitable for development, testing, staging, and production environments.

### **2. Migration Workflow**

1.  **Create a New Migration:** When a database change is required (e.g., adding a new field, renaming a collection, performing a data transformation), a new migration script is generated (`migrate-mongo create <migration-name>`).
2.  **Define Changes:** The developer implements the necessary database operations within the `up()` and `down()` functions of the migration script using MongoDB's native driver commands or Mongoose operations.
3.  **Version Control:** The migration script is committed to the relevant microservice's repository.
4.  **Local Testing:** Developers run migrations locally to ensure they work as expected (`migrate-mongo up` and `migrate-mongo down`).

### **3. Integration with CI/CD**

Migrations are automatically applied as part of our microservices' deployment pipelines.

1.  **Deployment Trigger:** When a microservice (e.g., the Reference Data Service) is deployed to any environment (development, staging, production) via our CI/CD pipeline.
2.  **Automated Migration Run:** The CI/CD script for that service will execute `migrate-mongo up` (or a similar command). This command checks the `_changelog` and applies any pending migrations to the target database.
3.  **Rollback (if needed):** In case of deployment issues, the `migrate-mongo down` command can be used to revert the last applied migration(s).

### **4. Best Practices for Migrations**

*   **Small, Atomic Changes:** Each migration should ideally focus on a single, isolated change to minimize complexity and risk.
*   **Idempotency:** Ensure migrations can be run multiple times without causing issues.
*   **Non-Blocking Operations:** Prefer non-blocking database operations to avoid service downtime, especially in production.
*   **Test Thoroughly:** Test migrations in all environments before deploying to production.
*   **Clear Naming:** Name migration files descriptively (e.g., `202510311200_add_provider_status_field_to_providers_collection.js`).
