# Database Interaction

This document provides guidelines for interacting with databases within the PCW application, ensuring efficient, secure, and maintainable data access.

## 1. Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) / Data Access Layers

*   **Use ORMs:** For relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL), use an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) like SQLAlchemy (Python) or TypeORM (TypeScript) to interact with the database. ORMs abstract away raw SQL, making code more readable and reducing the risk of SQL injection.
*   **Data Access Layer (DAL):** Implement a dedicated Data Access Layer (DAL) or Repository Pattern to encapsulate all database interaction logic. This separates data access concerns from business logic and makes it easier to switch databases or ORMs in the future.

## 2. Query Best Practices

*   **Avoid N+1 Queries:** Be mindful of the N+1 query problem, especially when fetching related data. Use eager loading (e.g., `select_related`, `prefetch_related` in Django ORM) to fetch all necessary data in a single query.
*   **Index Usage:** Ensure appropriate indexes are created on frequently queried columns to optimize read performance. Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` (PostgreSQL) to understand query plans.
*   **Batch Operations:** For bulk inserts, updates, or deletes, use batch operations provided by the ORM or database driver instead of individual statements.
*   **Avoid Raw SQL (Generally):** Prefer ORM methods over raw SQL. If raw SQL is absolutely necessary for complex queries or performance, ensure it is parameterized to prevent SQL injection.
*   **Pagination:** Implement pagination for large datasets to avoid fetching excessive amounts of data and improve application responsiveness.

## 3. Transactions

*   **ACID Properties:** Use database transactions to ensure Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID) for operations that involve multiple database changes.
*   **Short Transactions:** Keep transactions as short as possible to minimize locking and improve concurrency.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling and rollback mechanisms for failed transactions.

## 4. Connection Management

*   **Connection Pooling:** Use connection pooling to efficiently manage database connections, reducing overhead and improving performance.
*   **Secure Credentials:** Database credentials must be stored securely (e.g., in a secrets manager) and never hardcoded in the application.

## 5. Schema Design

*   **Normalization:** Design database schemas following normalization principles to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.
*   **Denormalization (Judiciously):** For read-heavy operations, judiciously denormalize data to improve query performance, but be aware of the trade-offs in data consistency.
*   **Documentation:** Document the database schema, including table relationships, indexes, and constraints.

## 6. NoSQL Database Interaction (e.g., MongoDB)

*   **Schema Design:** Understand the flexible schema nature of NoSQL databases and design document structures that align with access patterns.
*   **Indexing:** Create appropriate indexes for frequently queried fields.
*   **Aggregation Pipelines:** Utilize aggregation pipelines for complex data transformations and analysis.

By following these guidelines, we ensure that our data interactions are efficient, secure, and contribute to the overall stability and performance of the PCW application.
