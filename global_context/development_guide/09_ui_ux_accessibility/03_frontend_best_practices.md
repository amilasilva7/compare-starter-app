# Frontend Best Practices

This document outlines best practices for frontend development within the PCW application, focusing on performance, responsiveness, maintainability, and user experience.

## 1. Performance Optimization

*   **Minimize HTTP Requests:** Combine and minify CSS/JS files, use CSS sprites, lazy load images.
*   **Optimize Images:** Compress images, use appropriate formats (e.g., WebP), and serve responsive images.
*   **Lazy Loading:** Implement lazy loading for images, videos, and components that are not immediately visible.
*   **Code Splitting:** Break down JavaScript bundles into smaller chunks that are loaded on demand.
*   **Caching:** Leverage browser caching for static assets.
*   **Critical CSS:** Inline critical CSS for above-the-fold content to improve initial render performance.
*   **Web Vitals:** Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Largest Contentful Paint, Cumulative Layout Shift, First Input Delay).

## 2. Responsive Design

*   **Mobile-First Approach:** Design and develop for mobile devices first, then progressively enhance for larger screens.
*   **Fluid Grids & Flexible Images:** Use relative units (percentages, `em`, `rem`, `vw`, `vh`) for layouts and image sizes.
*   **Media Queries:** Utilize CSS media queries to apply styles based on screen size, orientation, and resolution.
*   **Viewport Meta Tag:** Ensure the `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">` tag is present in HTML.

## 3. Component-Based Development (React.js)

*   **Reusable Components:** Design components to be reusable, independent, and focused on a single responsibility.
*   **Props & State Management:** Clearly define component props and manage state effectively (e.g., using React Hooks, Zustand/Redux Toolkit).
*   **Pure Components/Memoization:** Use `React.memo` or `useMemo`/`useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components.
*   **Folder Structure:** Organize components logically (e.g., by feature, by type).

## 4. State Management

*   **Local Component State:** For simple UI state within a single component.
*   **Context API / Zustand / Redux Toolkit:** For global application state that needs to be shared across many components.
*   **React Query / SWR:** For managing server-side data fetching, caching, and synchronization.

## 5. Error Handling & User Feedback

*   **Graceful Degradation:** Ensure the application remains functional even if certain features or external APIs fail.
*   **Clear Error Messages:** Provide user-friendly error messages that guide users on how to resolve issues.
*   **Loading States:** Implement clear loading indicators for asynchronous operations.
*   **Form Validation:** Provide immediate and clear feedback on form input validation.

## 6. Security

*   **XSS Prevention:** Always sanitize and encode user-generated content before rendering it.
*   **CSRF Protection:** Ensure CSRF tokens are handled correctly for forms and API calls.
*   **Secure API Calls:** Use HTTPS for all API communication. Do not store sensitive information in local storage or cookies without encryption.

## 7. Testing

*   Follow the guidelines in [Testing Strategy](../../04_development_workflow/03_testing_strategy.md), with a focus on unit/component tests (Jest, React Testing Library) and E2E tests (Cypress).

## 8. Code Quality & Maintainability

*   **TypeScript:** Use TypeScript for type safety and improved code quality.
*   **Linting & Formatting:** Adhere to [Coding Standards & Linting](../../04_development_workflow/02_coding_standards_linting.md).
*   **Meaningful Naming:** Use clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and components.
*   **Modular CSS:** Use CSS Modules, Styled Components, or Tailwind CSS to scope styles and prevent conflicts.

By adhering to these frontend best practices, we aim to deliver a fast, responsive, and delightful user experience for our PCW application.
