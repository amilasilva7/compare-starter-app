# Accessibility Standards

Ensuring our PCW application is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, is a fundamental requirement. This document outlines the accessibility standards and best practices that all developers must adhere to.

## 1. Why Accessibility Matters

*   **Inclusivity:** Ensures everyone can use our application, regardless of ability.
*   **Legal Compliance:** Adherence to regulations like the Equality Act 2010 (UK) and WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).
*   **Improved UX for All:** Accessible design often leads to better usability for everyone.
*   **SEO Benefits:** Many accessibility best practices align with good SEO practices.

## 2. Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

We aim to comply with **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** standards. Familiarize yourself with the four main principles of WCAG:

*   **Perceivable:** Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
*   **Operable:** User interface components and navigation must be operable.
*   **Understandable:** Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
*   **Robust:** Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

## 3. Key Accessibility Best Practices for Developers

### a. Semantic HTML
*   Use appropriate HTML5 semantic elements (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, `<button>`, `<form>`) to convey meaning and structure to assistive technologies.
*   Avoid using `div` or `span` for interactive elements that have native HTML equivalents.

### b. Keyboard Navigation
*   Ensure all interactive elements are reachable and operable using only the keyboard (Tab, Enter, Spacebar).
*   Maintain a logical and visible focus order (`tabindex`).
*   Provide clear visual focus indicators.

### c. ARIA Attributes
*   Use WAI-ARIA (Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes when native HTML semantics are insufficient (e.g., for custom widgets, dynamic content updates).
*   **Rule of Thumb:** If you can use a native HTML element or attribute with the semantics and behavior you require, use it instead of ARIA.

### d. Color Contrast
*   Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and its background. Use contrast checker tools.
*   Do not rely solely on color to convey information.

### e. Images & Multimedia
*   Provide meaningful `alt` text for all `<img>` tags. If an image is purely decorative, use `alt=""`.
*   For complex images (charts, graphs), provide a longer description or a link to one.
*   Provide captions and transcripts for audio/video content.

### f. Forms
*   Associate labels with form controls using the `for` and `id` attributes.
*   Provide clear error messages that are programmatically associated with the form fields.
*   Use appropriate input types (e.g., `type="email"`, `type="number"`).

### g. Dynamic Content & State Changes
*   Use ARIA live regions (`aria-live`) to announce dynamic content updates to screen reader users (e.g., search results loading, form submission feedback).

## 4. Testing for Accessibility

*   **Automated Tools:** Integrate accessibility checkers into your development workflow (e.g., Axe DevTools, Lighthouse audits in Chrome DevTools).
*   **Manual Testing:** Conduct manual testing using:
    *   **Keyboard Navigation:** Navigate the entire application using only the keyboard.
    *   **Screen Readers:** Test with common screen readers (e.g., NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver).
*   **User Testing:** Include users with disabilities in user testing sessions.

## 5. Training & Resources

*   Regularly review WCAG guidelines and accessibility best practices.
*   Utilize online resources and training materials to deepen your understanding of accessible development.

By embedding accessibility into every stage of our development process, we ensure our PCW application is usable and beneficial for everyone.
